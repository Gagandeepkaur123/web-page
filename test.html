   <h5> JAVA </h5>
 <img class=a src="/home/gagandeep/Desktop/java.png" alt="Professional Speaker">
 <p> Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors. Java source code files (files with a .java extension) are compiled into a format called bytecode (files with a .class extension), which can then be executed by a Java interpreter.</p>

   <h5> Discrete Mathematics </h5>
 <img src="/home/gagandeep/Desktop/ds.jpg" alt="Professional Speaker">
 <p> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[2] </p>

   <h5> Computer Architecture </h5>
 <img src="/home/gagandeep/Desktop/ca.jpg" alt="Professional Speaker">
 <p> In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. </p>
